The next step is to prepare it, whcih includes \"cleaning data\", for instance finding missing or duplicate values, and converting data into a more organized format.  Once the data is clean and organized, it can be exploited.  We explore it, visualize it, build dashboards to track changes or compare two set of data.  Finally, once we have a good grasp of our data, we're ready to run experiments, like evaluate which article title gets the most hits, or to build predictive models, for example to forcast stock prices.  \n",

    "**Alright, we've mentioned the term pipeline several times by now, so lets focus on it for this lesson.  You may have heard the [data is new oil], as first coined by the economist, so lets follow this idea.  We extract crude oil from an oil field.  We moved the crude oil to a distillation unit, where we separate the oil into several products.  Some products are sent directly to their final users.  For example, some pipes go straight to airports to deliver kerosene.  Other products, like gasoline, are sent to gas storage facilities and stored in big tanks, before being distributed to gas stations.  Other products, like naphtha, go through several chemical transformations to create synthetic polymers for example.  Manufactures use synthetic polymers to create new products, like CDs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have many pipelines trying it all together.  CDs, Ss last century, Vivian thinks.  However, to manager data for Spotflix, she follows a procedure similar to oil processing.  Companies ingest data from many different sources, which needs to be processed and stored in various ways.  To handle that, we need [data pipelines] that efficiently automate the flow from one station to the next, so that data scientists can use up-to-date, accurate, relevant data.  This isn't a simple task and thats's why data engineers are so important.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At Spotflix, we have sources from which we extract data.  For example, the users' actions and listening history on the mobile Spotflix app and desktop Spotflix app, and the Spotflix website itself.  We also have website Spotflix uses internally, like their HR management system for payroll and benefits.  The data is ingested into Spotflix system, moving from their respective sources to our data lake (no fear, we will talk about data lakes in the next chapter).  These are our first three pipelines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We then organize the data, moving it into databases (we will talk more about databases in chapter 2 as well).  It could be [artist data], like name, number of followers, and associated acts, [albums data], like label, producer, year of release, [tracks data], like name, length, featured artists, and number of listens, [playlists data], like name, song it contains, and date of creation, [customer data], like username, account opening date, subscription tier, or [employees data], like name, salary, reporting manager, updated by human resources.  These are 6 new pipelines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some albums data can be extracted and stored directly.  For example, album cover pictures all have the same format, so we can store them directly without having to crop them.  That is one more pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Employees could be split in different tables by department, for example, sales, engineering, support, etc. (we will talk about tables in chapter 2 as well).  For now, that's 3 more pipelines.  These tables could be further split by offices, for example, US, Belgium, and UK.  If data scientists has to analyze employee data (to investigate employee turnover for example), this is the data they would use.  And three is anothet 3 more pipelines for each department.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tracks would need to be processed, first to check if the track is readable, then to check if the corresponding artist is in the database, to make sure the file is in the correct size and format, etc.  Thats 1 more pipeline, that we will unpack into chapter 3 when we will talk about ata processing.  The data can then be stored in a new, clean tracks database.  this is one of the databases data scientists could use to build a recommendation engine by analyzing songs for similarity, for example.  And thats our last pipeline.  \n",

    "In a nutshell, data pipelines ensures the data flows efficiently through the organization.  They automate extracting, transforming, combining, validating, and loading data, to reduce human intervention and errors, and decrease the time it takes for data to flow through the organization.  Dont worray, we'll cover this in detail in the last chapter.  One term you will hear a lot is [ETL].  Its a popular framework for designing data pipelines.  It breaks the flow of data into 3 sequential steps: first [Extracting data], then [Tranforming data], and finally [Loading to new database].  The key here is that data processed before its stored.  In general, data pipelines move data from one systemto another.  They may follow ETL, but not all the time.  For instance, the data may not be transformed, and routed directly to applications like visualization tools or Salesforce.  \n",

    "**Awesome job on chapter 1.  Lets continue our exploration of the world of data engineering.  This second chapter will focus on storage.  In this lesson, we're going to learn more about data structure.  Structured data is easy to search and organize.  Data is entered following a rigid structure, like a spreadsheet where there are set columns.  Each column takes values of a certain type, like text, data, or decimal.  It makes it easy to form relations, hence its organized in what is called a relational database.  About 20% of the data is structured.  SQL which stands for Structured Query Langurage, is used to query such data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of structured data. (slide shows a DF table).  This is an extract of Spotflix's employee table (index, last_name, first_name, role, team, full_time, office).  Its easy to read the table and well-organized.  You can see it follows a model: each row expects an employee and each column a specific information about that employee.  Each column needs to be of a certain type.  The index is a number, and acts as a unique ID, becuase 2 employee may have the same name, role and office.  The penultimate column holds logical values: values can only be true or false.  For example,  Rick Sanchez is part-time.  The rest of the columns are text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because its [structured] we can easily relate this table to other structured data.  For example, if there is another table holding information about offices, we can connect on the office column.  Tables that can be connected that way from a [relational database].  [Semi-structured data] resembles structured data, but allows more freedom.  Its therefore relatively easy to organize, and pretty structured, but allows more flexibility.  It also has different types and can be grouped to form relations, although this is not as straightforward as with structured data - you have to pay for that flexibility at some point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-structured data is stored in NoSQL databases (as opposed to SQL) and usually leverages the JSON, XML or YAML file formats.  Below is an example of a JSON file storing favorite artists of each Spotflix user.  As you can see, the model is consistent: each user id contains the user's last name and first name, and their favorite artists.  However, the number of favorite artists may differ: I have 4, Sara has 2 and Lis has 3 favorite artists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Relational databases dont allow that kind of flexibility, but semi-structured formats let you do it.  Unstructed data is the data that does not follow a model and can't be contained in a rows and columns format.  This makes it difficult to search and organize.  Its usually text, sounds, pictures or video.  Its usually stored in data lakes, althoughit can also appear in data warehouses or databases - don't worry, we will cover the difference between these at the end of this chapter.  \n",

    "Unstructed data can be extremely valuable, but because its hard to search and organize, this value could not be extracted untill recently, with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  At Spotflix, unstructed data consists in lyrics, songs, albums picture and artists profile pictures, and music videos.  At Spotflix, we could use machine learning algorithms to parse song spectrums, analyze beats per minutes, chord progressions, genres to help categorize songs.  Or, we could have artists give additional informati when they upload their songs.  Having them add the genre, and some tags, would make it semi-structured data, and would make searching and organizing easier.  \n",

Its the preferred langurage to query RDBMS or Relational Database Management System - sically systems that gather several tabels like Employee table from the previous lesson, where all tables are related to each other.  More on that in a moment.  \n",

Most programming langurage let you do that, but SQL was the first, which is why its been so influential.  Its a little bit like the Beatles and pop music.  Its also very close to English, which makes it easy to write and understand.  As you already know data engineers use SQL to create maintain databases, while data scientists use SQL to query databases.  We're not going to learn SQL in this course, not test you on it: we have great courses and tracks that covers this topic.  However, looking at some examples will help you understanding.  \n",

    "Take a moment to refresh your memory of Spotflix exmplyee table.  Remember the first column holds non-decimal numbers, the penultimate one store logic value, and the others hold text.  We can create such a table using SQL.  We type the command [CREAT TABEL], and declare the name of the table, \"employees\", then we proceed to create the first column, employee_id, and specify the type of data expected, integers - means this columns will only accept whole numbers, without any decimal.  We then create second column, first_name, and specify it should be text (VARCHAR stands for \"variable characters\").  255 here means that the value entered can't be more than 255 characters long.  And we do the same for last_name, role, and team.  We declare full_time as a Boolean, which is the type for logical values.  this column can only holds 0 or 1.  Then office is declared as VARCHAR as well because its text.  Data engineers then run other statements to update the table and write records into it.  \n",
