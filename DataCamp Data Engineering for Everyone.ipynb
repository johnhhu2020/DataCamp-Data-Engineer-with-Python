    "In 2019, the average salary for data engineers overtook data scientists. How did this happen? Companies wanting to find the gold within their data realized it wasn’t possible if they hadn’t yet built the mine. Data engineers lay the foundations that make data science possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you’ll learn about a data engineer’s core responsibilities, how they differ from data scientists, and facilitate the flow of data through an organization. Through hands-on exercises you’ll follow Spotflix, a fictional music streaming company, to understand how their data engineers collect, clean, and catalog their data. By the end of the course, you’ll understand what your company's data engineers do, be ready to have a conversation with a data engineer, and have a solid foundation to start your own data engineer journey.

First, we collect and ingest the data, from web traffic, surveys, or media consumption for example.  Data is stored in raw format.  The next step is to prepare it, whcih includes \"cleaning data\", for instance finding missing or duplicate values, and converting data into a more organized format.  Once the data is clean and organized, it can be exploited.  We explore it, visualize it, build dashboards to track changes or compare two set of data.  Finally, once we have a good grasp of our data, we're ready to run experiments, like evaluate which article title gets the most hits, or to build predictive models, for example to forcast stock prices.  \n",

If the data is scattered around, corrupted, and diffcult to access, there is not much to prepare, explore, or experiment with.  And thats exactly why you need a Data Engineer: their job is to deliver the correct data, in the right form, to the right people, as efficiently as possible.  They ingest data from different sources, optimize the databases for analysis, and manage data corruption.  \n",

Big data can be defined as data so large you have to think about how to deal with its size, because its difficult to process using traditional data management methods.
